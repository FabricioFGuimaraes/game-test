Questions 1 to 4 was described in a TXT file with the question and my answer just below of each question

Obs: for question 5, 6 and 7
  -> I managed to compile the server and the client in the master branch, but I couldn't make the two communicate in any way, I tried a lot of things, running the local website to proper create account and characters, step by step on configuring the mysql database and migrations, managed to create with object builder the .spr and .dat compatible with the 10.98 client but I still having errors about game protocols. I used an compiled release version of the server (version 1.42) to do the question 5 and 7.
  -> Question 6 Unfortunately I couldn't do it, due to all the problems I encountered, I'm sorry about that

Question 5 I just create a new spell and execute when the word "frigo" is typed on the game client chat, I tried to do as similar as possible, but as I can't compile the server, I couldn't change the way the spell is animated.
Question 7 I made a new module and loaded on game start
